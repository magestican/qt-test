## Excercise 2

**NOTE**: For this excercise the code DOES need to be working.

1. Using "Create React App" build a react application and update the UI using Bootstrap/MaterialUI

2. Create a mock api from a static json file using either:

	* GraphQL: `https://github.com/marmelab/json-graphql-server`
	* REST: `https://github.com/typicode/json-server`

3. Create a view in react that now displays data from your api

4. Now write a search component that allows a user to search for records in the db (client side is ok)

5. Write a higher order component that does some validation on the search page before loading the data.
